# Scum: A Simple Compiler in Scala

## Overview

Scum is a minimalistic compiler designed to demonstrate the fundamentals of compiler construction. It is implemented
in Scala, leveraging its functional programming capabilities and strong static type system. This project aims to
provide an educational tool for understanding how compilers work, from parsing source code to executing basic 
operations.

## Features

Coming soon... (I hope)
